Meal Helper

We made this project in order to help people plan out their daily meals and lead healthy lives.

It allows user to create profiles, set caloric goals, and adhere to them through recommended meals based upon a number of specifications. A more robust verison of this project will provide more guidance and information than analogous platforms such as MyFitnessPal, which allow users to track their daily caloric and nutrition information but do not provide users with meal recommendations or keep track of the food items that are available_meals to them.

This project is currently in its early stages but does include a Command Line Interface that allows users to build profiles, provide information and receive meal recommendations based upon our seed data.

To use the program, plus clone to repository to your local computer and enter ruby bin/run.rb, then follow the instructions given.

The project was made by Chris Stull, Nicki Liu and Sean Para in the Ruby language, using Active Record to interface with sqlite3.
